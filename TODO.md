TODO
====
* Finish the first approach to launcher
    * Make the file selector be integrated
    * Make sure it's working
    * Make the config file get extra params for emulators
        * emulator = mame
        * emu_params = -fs ...

* Make emu-launcher be skinnable
    * Right now should be easy:
        * Create skin folder, and put inside all the media
        * Put the actual media into "default" skin
        * Check if all the necessary files exists, if not, the default skin will be used

* Make fileselector be better, and change the background
